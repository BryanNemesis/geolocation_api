registration/authentication:
 - (DONE) create a view for user registration.
 - (DONE) create a view for obtaining a token for the user
 - authenticate API endpoints using the token

 API endpoints:
 'store' - POST method, IP in request, store geolocation data for ip in the db
 'detail' - GET, view saved data for ip. maybe add option for viewing pretty data and full data
 to flex that i can make a serializer?
 'list' - GET, view all saved geolocation data
 'delete' - DELETE, delete data for ip from db

 Write tests for all apps, users as well!
